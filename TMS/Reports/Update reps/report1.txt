REPORT 1:

Steps taken so far:
- Built a simple test network and simulation manually to understand SUMO
- Smulated a crash on said network
- Generated a 10*10 grid with the Netgenerate method
- Imported OSM maps of Downtown Ottawa and lower Manhattan (approx 17th St to bottom of CP)
- Wrote and tested ambulancetrack.py:
	-reroutes ambulance to crash site (manually not dynamically)
	-prints edge and pos of ambulance every 10 steps


Observations:
Ottawa
-Randomly generted traffic on Ottawa map has big problem, all traffic bottlenecks across the same intersection of three streets I suspect there is 
an import problem in which many connections are not maintained. Only option used was --try-join-tls

NYC
-1st nyc map built with no options, nycmap1.net built with options listed in "cmd line options to remember", nyymap2.net built with all options except --try-tls-join 
in attempt to get rid of warnings (unsuccessful). 
-Steets go EW , in general even streets are one way eastboud and odd are westbound, but several exceptions. Similarly aves go NS



														***
cmd line options to remember:

Netconvert from OSM
--guess-ramps 
--remove-edges.by-vclass 
hov,taxi,bus,delivery,transport,lightrail (or tram),cityrail (or rail_urban),rail_slow (or rail),rail_fast (or rail_electric),motorcycle,bicycle,pedestrian 
--remove-geometry --remove-isolated --try-join-tls --verbose 

														****
**Issues**
Warning :
could not bulid program '0' for traffic light <NUMBER>
Warning:
The taffic light <NUMBER> does not control any links, it will not be built
Are al tc properly defined?
