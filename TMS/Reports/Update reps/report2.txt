REPORT 2:

Acheived:
-sendEmergencyVehicle(v,c) function which takes a vehID and an ID number to instantiate the ambulance, it sends an emergency vehicle to the location of the crashed
vehicle
- have a loop which detects stalled vehicles by checking their "wait time", there is one major issue with this however since vehicles stalled behind a crash will have
a similar wait time and be incorrectly classified as crashes. For the moment te model only deals with one crash
- as of 17/10 this has been tested on a 10*10 grid successfully (i.e. the ambulance enters at a random point and instanty reroutes to crash location).
- getNextEdge function(v) determines edge and route of a vehicle and returns the next edge 
- getNextLight(v) returns the next light to be encountered by v
- drawn ROUGH flowchart


Observations:
-Time of each simulation step = 1s
-Distance is (I think) in metres, distance function SHOULD be okay
- Some features (like ambulancecount) suport the use of multiple ambulances, but at the oment only one is being considered for simplicity. See the crash detection
section in accomplishmnets
-traci.vehicle.getRoadID(ambulanceID) in traci.vehicle.getRoute(ambulanceID) has to be used to avoid trying to get next light from a junction


Next Step: 
-find estimated time to get to next light
-find duration of tl
-find difference between "phase" and "duration" etc
